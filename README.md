# Module1-Projects
 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
 
 My goal for this project was to combine a bunch of different technologies from the previous 3 assignments that we have completed in order to get a better understanding about how things worked within Unity.
 
 The movement around the world is from Roll-A-Ball, the score/high score counting and the moving slop obstacle is from Apple Picker, and finally the end goal and being able to knock down objects is from Mission Demolition.
